This project is a simple yet effective content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on their associated tags (genres, plot keywords, etc.). It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to find the similarity between movies based on user-defined or preprocessed tags.

#Features
Tag-based content filtering

Cosine similarity for recommendations

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset

Scalable for large datasets

#Dataset:
The project uses the MovieLens dataset (or any movie dataset with tags and metadata). Key features include:

movieId: Unique identifier for each movie

title: Name of the movie

About: genres, overview, cast, crew 

created tags: Tags or keywords associated with the movie by adjoining the genres, oerview, etc.

#Tech Stack:
Python 3.x

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity computation

Numpy for numerical operations

Streamlit / Flask (optional) for UI

#Working:
Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled and relevant columns are combined into a single "tag" column.

Text Preprocessing:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation and stopwords

Stemming or lemmatization (optional)

Vectorization: Tags are converted into vectors using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.

Similarity Matrix: Cosine similarity is calculated between movie vectors.

Recommendation Function: Based on a selected movie, the most similar movies are retrieved and shown.
